5. Type your command into the command box and press `Enter` to execute it. 

    Some sample commands to try:
   * `add [p] n/Bob Tan p/98765876 e/bot@gmail.com a/262 Serangoon Central Drive 1-125 j/1 INPROGRESS`: Adds a new contact name Bob Tan to the address book
   * `list [p]`: Lists all contacts
   * `delete [p] Alex Lee`: Deletes job applicant named **Alex Lee** from the address book
   * `clear`: Deletes all contacts.
   * `exit`: Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#Features) below for details of each command.

## Features
### :information_source: Notes about the command format:
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. 
  
  e.g. in add n/NAME, NAME is a parameter which can be used as add n/John Doe.


* Items in square brackets are optional. 
  
  e.g n/NAME [j/APPLICATION] can be used as n/John Doe j/1 INPROGRESS or as n/John Doe.


* Items with …​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.

  e.g. [j/APPLICATION]…​ can be used as   (i.e. 0 times), j/1 INPROGRESS, j/2 ACCEPTED etc.


* Parameters can be in any order.
    
  e.g. if the command specifies n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER, p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME is also acceptable.


* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.

  e.g. if you specify p/12341234 p/56785678, only p/56785678 will be taken.


* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as help, list, exit and clear) will be ignored.

  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
