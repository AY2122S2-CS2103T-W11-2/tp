## Applicant Features
### :information_source: Notes about the command format regarding Applicants:
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. 
  
  e.g. in add n/NAME, NAME is a parameter which can be used as add n/John Doe.


* Items in square brackets are optional. 
  
  e.g n/NAME [p/PHONE_NUMBER] can be used as n/John Doe p/PHONE_NUMBER or as n/John Doe.


* Items with ... after them can be used multiple times including zero times.

  e.g. [a/ADDRESS]... can be used as   (i.e. 0 times), a/ADDRESS, a/ADDRESS etc.


* Parameters can be supplied in any order.
    
  e.g. if the command requires n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER, <br> p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME is also acceptable.


* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.

  e.g. if you specify p/12341234 p/56785678, only p/56785678 will be taken.


* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as help, list, exit and clear) will be ignored.

  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

## Storage
### Saving the data
AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

&nbsp;
### Editing the data file
AddressBook data are saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

:exclamation: **Caution:** If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, the address book will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.


&nbsp;
### Importing the data file: `import`

Imports all persons data from a *csv* or *json* save file generated from this address book.

File Format:
* CSV (tab delimited): name    phone_number    email_address    address    job_description    application_stage
* JSON: Follows the existing file data structure. 

Notes:
1. Filepath can be relative or absolute.
2. No duplicates are allowed to be imported into the address book.
   1. Data in the address book has a higher priority than data in the save file.
3. If any error is found, **none** of the data in the save file will be imported into the address book. 

Format: `import FILEPATH`

Example: `import C:\Users\<your username>\Desktop\data.csv` or `import ..\test\data.json`

&nbsp;
### Exporting to a csv data file: `export`

Exports all applicant data from the address book to a *csv* save file.

File Format:
* CSV (tab delimited): name    phone_number    email_address    address    job_description    application_stage <br>

Notes:
1. Filepath of specified CSV file can be either relative or absolute.
2. File name of csv file **cannot** contain any front or back slashes.
    1. Invalid csv file name with front slash: myCSVfile\\.csv
    2. Invalid csv file name with back slash: myCSVfile/.csv
3. Specifying the same csv file name and path will overwrite the data inside the specified csv file.
4. If any error is found while executing the command,
   **none** of the data from the addressbook will be exported into the specified csv file.

Format: `export FILEPATH`

Absolute filepath example for WindowsOS: `export C:\Users\<YOUR_USERNAME>\Desktop\myData.csv` <br>
Relative filepath example for WindowsOS: `export ./myData.csv` <br><br>
Absolute filepath example for MacOS: `export  /Users/<YOUR_USERNAME>/Downloads/myDataFile.csv` <br>
