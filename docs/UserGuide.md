    Some sample commands to try:
   * `add [p] n/Bob Tan p/98765876 e/bot@gmail.com a/262 Serangoon Central Drive 1-125 
   j/Software Developer s/INPROGRESS`: Adds a new applicant named Bob Tan to the applicant list
   * `list [p]`: Lists all applicants
   * `delete [i] 1`: Deletes interview index **1** from the interview list
   * `clear [i]`: Clear all interviews.
   * `exit`: Exits the app.

6. Refer to [Features](#features) section directly below for details on each command.

# Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format regarding Features:**<br>

* Items in angle brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g n/NAME <p/PHONE_NUMBER> can be used as n/John Doe p/PHONE_NUMBER or as n/John Doe.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in add n/NAME, NAME is a parameter which can be used as add n/John Doe.

* Items with ellipsis (...) after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. <a/ADDRESS>... can be used as   (i.e. 0 times), a/ADDRESS, a/ADDRESS etc.

* Parameters can be supplied in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command requires n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER, <br> p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify p/12341234 p/56785678, only p/56785678 will be taken.

</div>

Adds a new job applicant to the address book.

Format: `add [p] n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS j/JOB_POSITION s/STAGE`

## Storage
----------
### Saving the data
AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

&nbsp;
### Editing the data file
AddressBook data are saved as a JSON file `PATH_TO_JAR_FILE/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

:exclamation: **Caution:** If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, the address book will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. <br><br>
:exclamation: **Caution:** Inconsistent data resulting from manual modification of the data file should not be considered as unexpected behaviour.

&nbsp;
### Importing the data file: `import`

Imports all **job applicants** data from a *csv* save file generated from this address book.

File structure for csv file (tab delimited): 

name | phone number | email | address | job title | stage

Notes:
1. Filepath can be relative or absolute.
2. No duplicates are allowed to be imported into the address book.
   1. Data in the address book has a higher priority than data in the save file.
3. Save files needs to end with `.csv` in order for the address book to recognise the save file. 
4. If any error is found, **none** of the data in the save file will be imported into the address book.

Format: `import FILEPATH`

Example:<br>
`import C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\Desktop\data.csv`

&nbsp;
### Exporting to a csv data file: `export`

Exports all **job applicants** data from the address book into a *csv* save file.

File structure for csv file (tab delimited): 

name | phone number | email | address | job title | stage

Notes:
1. Filepath of specified CSV file can be relative or absolute.
2. File name of csv file **cannot** contain any front or backslashes.
   1. Invalid csv file name with front slash: myCSVfile\\.csv
   2. Invalid csv file name with backslash: myCSVfile/.csv
3. Specifying the same csv file name and path will overwrite the data inside the specified csv file.
4. Csv file **must** have .csv as a file extension. 
5. If any error is found while executing the command, 
**none** of the data from the addressbook will be exported into the specified csv file.

Format: `export FILEPATH`

Absolute filepath example for WindowsOS: `export C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\Desktop\myData.csv` <br>
Relative filepath example for WindowsOS: `export ./myData.csv` <br><br>
Absolute filepath example for MacOS: `export  /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Downloads/myDataFile.csv` <br>
Relative filepath example for MacOS: `export  ./myDataFile.csv`

:exclamation: **Important:** Data in exported csv file will look different depending on the application used to view the
file even though the data is seperated by tabs.
