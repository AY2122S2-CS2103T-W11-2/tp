### Project: HRConnect

HRConnect is a desktop address book application used for keeping track of job applicants' details during their entire application process. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Edit Feature**: Added the ability to edit details of job applicants.
  * What it does: allows the user to update any current details of job applicants that were added previously.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes when adding a new job applicant and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
  * Highlights: to be added soon

* **Export Feature**: Added the ability to export the data from the address book to a csv file.
  * What it does: allows the user to export the details from the most current version of the address book to a csv 
  file.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user's address book can start to fill up 
  with contacts that are no longer important and the app should provide a convenient way to archive data.
