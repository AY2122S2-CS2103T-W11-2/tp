### Project: HRConnect

HRConnect is a desktop address book application used for keeping track of job applicants' details during their entire application process. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to edit details of job applicants.
  * What it does: allows the user to update any current details of job applicants that were added previously.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes when adding a new job applicant and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
  * Highlights: to be added soon
  * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*
