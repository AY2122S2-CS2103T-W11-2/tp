# Project: HRConnect

HRConnect is a desktop application for managing the contacts of job applicants. <br>
It can also be used to keep track of: <br>
* stage progress of each applicant during the application process
* interviews with each applicant
* miscellaneous tasks that need to be completed

Given below are my contributions to the project.
